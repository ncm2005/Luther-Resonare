# [Resonare] 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: [Luther]

### Team Members
- Member 1: [Niveditha C M] - [TKM College of engineering]
- Member 2: [Jiyanna Susan] - [TKM College of engineering]

### Hosted Project Link
[https://github.com/ncm2005/Luther-Resonare]

### Project Description
[Resonare is an anonymous feedback portal for college students, allowing them to submit, view, and react to feedback safely. It helps improve communication, address concerns, and promote transparency within the college community]

### The Problem statement
[In many colleges, students hesitate to share their honest opinions or concerns due to fear of judgment or exposure. Existing feedback systems are often ineffective, non-anonymous, or lack real-time engagement, making it difficult for administration to understand and address student issues.]

### The Solution
[Resonare provides a secure, anonymous, and user-friendly platform for students to submit feedback. It allows real-time sharing of opinions, reactions, and replies while maintaining privacy, enabling college authorities to understand student concerns effectively and take timely actions]

## Project Documentation

### For Software:

#### Screenshots (Add at least 3)

![Screenshot1](homepage.png)
*The home page of Resonare showing navigation bar, main title, and access to Write/View Feedback sections.*

![Screenshot2](view.png)
*The View Feedback page displaying submitted feedbacks, reactions (emojis), and reply option.*

![Screenshot3](write.png)
*The Write Feedback page where students can submit anonymous feedback with category and urgency selection.*

#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram](mermaid-diagram.png)
*Student / User: Submits feedback and reacts to existing feedback.
-Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS): Collects inputs, displays feedback, reacts to backend APIs.
-Backend (Node.js/Express): Handles all API requests, stores feedback, manages reactions and replies, serves analytics.
-In-Memory Storage / Database: Stores all feedback data, reactions, and replies.
-Admin Panel: Allows admin to log in and view analytics, moderate, or filter feedback.*

**Application Workflow:**

![Workflow](docs/workflow.png)
*1.User opens the app → sees the home page with options.
2.Write Feedback → fills form → submitted to backend, stored in memory or database.
3.View Feedback → frontend fetches feedback → displays cards.
4.User can react (like, dislike, emoji) or reply → updates backend → frontend refreshes to show latest counts and replies.*
